DU Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 2

## Overview of Project
This VBA project serves users by automating stocks analysis for a given data set included in the VBA_Challenge file. The automation enhances user ability to make investment decisions by giving users a view of historical stock performance during years provided.

### Purpose
The purpose of the macro programmed into the spreadsheet is to make better use of an analyst's time be creating an efficient table to view summarized information on the population of stocks in the dataset. Historical information was provided for years 2017 and 2018, with each year comprising approximately 3,000 lines of data. In order to analyze the data, a summary table based on some chosen key metrics enables the user to get much more clear and concise information and much more rapidly.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenge of VBA development in this module was improving on some of the more basic Excel knowledge to automate routine table building. The specific focus of much of the module was to create efficient code that would summarize the data while not consuming unnecessary memory. In order to accomplish this, the challenge really became to go through the logic of the intial code developed in the module and try to refine it in the challenge in order to output the same results, but with better performance. A start and end timer was implemented into the code to measure results of performance.

The left image above displays the time consumed to run the code from the initial module activity, while the code on the right displays the time after code refactoring for performance improvements. Looping the FOR statements and creation of the tickerIndex to reduce the amount of iterations improved code performance by just over 84% for the 2017 data!

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
